## apple tree

a place to hold some code while I explore creating a fractal tree in appleSoft basic following

I have made a p5js version using the basic logic.

It still makes recursive calls but with global variables and a stack to keep track of positions

So it seems that basic has no problem wih multiple calls to a subroutine but it must have a stack.

modern languages the stack is built into the frames that are passed in a recursive call so you don't need to implement you own stack.  but you can if you want to as i have done in appleTreeP5
